The Statick ROS-M Upload Plugin is a plugin for Statick to generate output compatible with the ROS-M registry.
You should only care about this plugin if you are involved with the ROS-M registry.

## Additions to Statick
This plugin introduces a new reporting plugin to Statick.
The plugin should be automatically detected the next time you run Statick.

## Use Cases
This plugin generates a .json file which can be manually uploaded to the ROS-M registry.
Future work will add support for automatically uploading to the registry.

## Example Confg.yaml

* Generate a config file in `rsc` directory with the following structure
``` yaml
rosm:
  rest:
    url: <url to the ros rest service>
    apiKey: <api key for accessing ROSM rest services>
```

## Testing
* setup `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* `python setup.py install`
* `pip install .`
* `pytest`
* For local debugging use `pip install . && pytest -s -q -v`
